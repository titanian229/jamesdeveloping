# jamesdeveloping.ca

This is the repo for my personal webpage, jamesdeveloping.ca

It's mobile first, and looks good on both small and large viewports.  It uses subtle CSS animations written by me as well as several from the animate.css library.  It also uses Bootstrap for styling, jQuery, the font Quicksand from Google Fonts, and icons from FontAwesome.

The website is a single page, using hidden elements hiding and showing to switch between the About, Portfolio, and Contact sections.  It includes a brief bio state, several examples of my work, and contact information including my LinkedIn profile and GitHub profile.

Here is a video demonstrating all of the functionality and content:
